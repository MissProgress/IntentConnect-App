# IntentConnect: Prioritize People, Not Tasks

## What is IntentConnect?

IntentConnect is the accountability partner for your relationships. 
In our busy schedules, it's easy to let important friendships and family connections fade simply because they slip from our minds.  We remember deadlines and meetings, but often forget to call a parent or check in on an old friend. 
This app is designed to help you **nurture your relationships consistently** by treating people as priorities, not after thoughts. It's a simple, respectful system that ensures the people whom you love stay top-of-mind.

## Why It Matters

This product solves the **"Out of sight, out of mind"** problem.
Existing apps focus solely on *tasks* and *productivity*. IntentConnect focuses on **emotional consistency**. It closes the gap between *caring* about loved ones and *actually connecting* with them. By providing gentle, intentional reminders,  it helps users build and maintain strong emotional bonds in a busy world.

## Who Is It For?

* **Busy Professionals:** Those who often feel guilty for losing touch with friends and family due to demanding work schedules.
* **Individuals With Large Networks:** Those who struggle to balance outreach across different circles (family, friends, colleagues).
* **Anyone** who wants to be more **intentional** and **consistent** in maintaining their most important relationships.

  ## Key Features

  * **Scheduled Check-ins:** Easily set up recurring reminders for calls or messages, daily, weekly,  or monthly for each contact.
  * **Grouped Contacts:** organize your contacts into groups (Family, Friends, Acquaintances) and manage separate consistency goals for each group.
  * **In-Call Notes:** Quickly jot down details about your conversation (e.g., "Sick and in the hospital") that will appear before your next reminder to ensure thoughtful follow-up.
  * **Consistency Insights:** View weekly and monthly summaries showing who you've connected with and who you haven't called in a while, turning relationship maintenance into a visible, rewarding habit.
 
    ## Built With Intention

    This product is designed for simplicity, ease of use, and privacy,  ensuring that connecting with loved ones is a joyful habit, not a chore.
